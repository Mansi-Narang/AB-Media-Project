npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## ðŸ§¯ Troubleshooting

* **MongoDB connection error**: Ensure your MongoDB service is running and URI is correct in `.env`
* **CORS issue**: Confirm `VITE_API_BASE_URL` matches the backend server's URL
* **Port conflict**: Check if ports `5000` (backend) and `5173` (frontend) are free or update them
